## README on Samsung Accelerometers script run_analysis.R

### 0. Note to install package 'data.table' before running this script!
### 1. Merge training and testdata into one set
I've added one extra column (ID 562) for partion 'train' or 'test' values to distinguish between them still later on.
### 2. Extract measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
### 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
### 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
